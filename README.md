Sonic Mania on le Web. Press ESC to access dev menu to get to levels. (if my box.com link stays up, this has a better load time than the vinmannie build.)

Known Issues:

 -Crashes when entering the main menu after the title screen.

 -Can't access Encore Mode, only Encore themed levels.

 -Puyo Puyo mode crashes upon selecting difficulty.

 -Stardust Speedway Act 2's Metal Sonic boss crashes when he enters the room where you launch tiny robo sonics at him. and unfortunately debug mode won't fix this as trying to skip to the final Metal Sonic phase will crash the game as well.

 -Oil Ocean Act 2 crashes upon boot, most likely due to the steam and/or gas hazard throughout the level being loaded.

 -Metallic Madness Act 1 crashes upon boot, most likely due to the complex structure of the background segments.

 -Trying to progress in the 4-way section of Titanic Monarch Act 2 will crash the game.

These are the bugs I've come across so far. If there's any more bugs not listed here or if there's a solution to the above bugs, then make an issue with the bug or solution. (I unfortunately do not know how to edit the actual code this runs on that could fix these bugs.)
